/*
  # Temporarily disable RLS for webhook debugging

  1. Purpose
    - Disable Row Level Security on tables that the stripe-webhook needs to update
    - This is a temporary measure to debug the "Missing authorization header" error
    - Once webhook is working, we should re-enable RLS with proper policies

  2. Tables affected
    - advisor_assessments
    - assessment_results  
    - stripe_orders
    - stripe_customers
    - stripe_subscriptions

  3. Security Note
    - This temporarily removes access restrictions
    - Should be reversed once webhook authentication is fixed
